# Game of Life

This project was to recreate [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), with the addition of being able to mutate the ruleset and observe how that changes the outcome.

This project uses typescript react and SASS for the UI and will be using Rust compiled to WASM for higher performance calculation of the game state.
